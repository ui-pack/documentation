# Installation
Start by installing ui-pack with your package manager of choice

### React
```bash tabs='npm|yarn'
npm i @ui-pack/react
--
yarn add @ui-pack/react
```

### Script
```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@ui-pack/react@0.0.5/index.js"></script>
```

### Styling
With ui-pack you do not need to worry about any additional steps to add styles to your components
as basic styles are injected in the page. As a component library that's focused on UI implementation
but not heavily opinionated on appearance, the default styles can be overriden easily.
