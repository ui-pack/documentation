Start by installing ui-pack with your package manager of choice

## React
```bash tabs='npm|yarn'
npm i @ui-pack/react
--
yarn add @ui-pack/react
```

### Importing
You may import from the default export of each component
```jsx
import Masonry from '@ui-pack/react/masonry'
```

or import the component from the index module that contains all other components.

```jsx
import { Masonry } from '@ui-pack/react'
```

<Note type="warn">

Using a member import like above can lead to larger bundle sizes as it loads all components,
including the ones you may not be using. It is often better to import directly from the
smaller modules, using default style imports unless you use a bundler that transforms your
code like [babel-plugin-transform-imports](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-transform-imports)
or choose to rely on tree-shaking (which can be a hit or miss).

</Note>

## Script
```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@ui-pack/react@0.0.5/index.js"></script>
```

## Styling
With ui-pack you do not need to worry about any additional steps to add styles to your components
as basic styles are injected in the page. As a component library that's focused on UI implementation
but not heavily opinionated on appearance, the default styles can be overriden easily.
