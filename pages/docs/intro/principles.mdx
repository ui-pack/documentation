# Principles
UI pack was created with the goal to provide secondary interactive frontend components that have been through
a lot of research and tests. The aim is not to be a generalized design system or component library for a
company or project to adopt, as we feel project teams often prefer to come up with their own component libraries
for frequently used components like buttons, badges, or things that primarily define appearance.

UI pack focuses a lot on user research to provide a smooth web experience for the users of our users. One of the
ways we rely on research is by leaning on [open-UI][1] - a web platform incubator community group. Open-ui is
made up of various industry experts that will like to see a web where there are standardized definitions of
various pieces of a UI such that library authors like us and many others, can follow to create a shared and
seamless experience across the web.

As ui pack components leaves a lot of the appearance decision to its users, the benefit of relying on a network of
research is not to have you create interfaces that look the same as everyone else's but to ensure that for each
component we provide, accessibility requirements for such controls are met along with the expected states and
behaviors.

As story-telling is a part of user experience design, and we want to provide you with a good experience while
consuming our component APIs, we also try to tell stories and histories through links in the **notes section**
of each component. Some components we provide may be incubated projects by web community groups looking to
ship with browsers at some future date. UI pack will try to stay informed with the news on these native element
equivalents of components in our library, and link to resources on them.

An important part of the research and story-telling for us is that it also helps us determine those industry
heroes that deserve appreciation and recognition for their work on features and implementations that end up
becoming native features of our favorite web browsers.

### Least power
We like the W3's [rule of least power][2] and hope that the APIs provided by UI pack require very little to
no configuration, as much little power as we can make possible through the API usage while having unlimited
power in implementation, customization, and control.
