UI pack was created with the goal to provide secondary interactive frontend components
that have been through a lot of research and tests. The aim is not to be a generalized
design system or component library for a company or project to adopt, as a lot of project
teams often prefer to roll their own component libraries, or use one of the many existing
ones for frequently used components like buttons, badges, and similar components that
define visual theme.

Some components offered by ui-pack are features proposed to be native to the web platform
but may not have good enough cross-browser support. To achieve an API design and behavior
similar to proposed solutions for the web platform, we keep a close attention to existing
implementations, standard proposals, and organizations like [open-ui][1] that is made up
of industry experts dedicated to research and finding ways to unify how UI and
accessibility experiences are made across the web.

With all appearance decisions left to you, the benefit of relying on a network of research
is not to have you create interfaces that look the same as everyone else's but to ensure
that for each component, the states, behaviors, and accessibility do not differ from
what your users expect from using other good interfaces.

## Least power
We like the W3's [rule of least power][2] and hope that the APIs provided by UI pack
require very little to no configuration, providing as much little power as can be possible
through the API usage while having unlimited power in implementation, customization,
and control.
