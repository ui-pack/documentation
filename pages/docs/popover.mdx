# Popover

Popover is a grid layout that allows varying image dimensions with equal spacing. Unlike common grids,
the rows are not confined to fixed heights. Simpler implementations of this layout like the
[CSS multi-column layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Columns) flows on a
column-by-column basis. However, this has a sinistrodextral flow (left-to-right) by rows.
