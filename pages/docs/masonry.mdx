# Masonry

Masonry is a grid layout that allows varying image dimensions with equal spacing. Unlike common grids,
the rows are not confined to fixed heights. Simpler implementations of this layout like the
[CSS multi-column layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Columns) flows on a
column-by-column basis. However, this has a sinistrodextral flow (left-to-right) by rows.

## Usage

Component modules can be individually imported

```jsx
import Masonry from '@ui-pack/react/masonry'
```

or you may import the component from the index module that contains all other components.

```jsx live=true
function App(){
  const items = [
    'm/200/120',
    'a/200/170',
    's/220/150',
    'o/180/90',
    'n/200/230',
    'r/250/200',
    'y/260/220',
  ]
  return (
    <Masonry columns="3" gap="10px">
      {items.map(item => (
        <Image key={item} src={`https://picsum.photos/seed/${item}`} alt="" />
      ))}
    </Masonry>
  )
}
```

> Note this is not recommended in most cases as it can lead to larger bundle sizes
