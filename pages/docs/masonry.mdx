# Masonry

Masonry is a grid layout that allows varying image dimensions with equal spacing. Unlike common grids,
the rows are not confined to fixed heights. Simpler implementations of this layout like the
[CSS multi-column layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Columns) flows on a
column-by-column basis. However, this has a sinistrodextral flow (left-to-right) by rows.

## Usage

Component modules can be individually imported

```jsx
import Masonry from '@ui-pack/react/masonry'
```

or you may import the component from the index module that contains all other components.

```jsx
import { Masonry } from '@ui-pack/react'
```

> Note this is not recommended in most cases as it can lead to larger bundle sizes
